The ArgoCD integration for Keptn utilizes Argo Rollouts, which is a k8s controller and set of CRDs providing various deployment capabilities to k8s, such as blue-green, canary, and more. It optionally integrates with ingress controllers and service meshes. Rollouts can also query metrics from providers such as Prometheus to drive promotion or rollback.
